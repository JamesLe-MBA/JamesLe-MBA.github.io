# pacmen
So, in this exercise, we're going to create PacMen on-the-fly. We're going to put a button on our 
webpage, and that when we click that button, a new PacMan will be created and will start moving 
around, bouncing off the walls. And so, we need to understand how to store all these PacMen, 
and we're going to do that in array. And this is typically how we store groups of things. And so,
each time we create a PacMen, we're going to push it onto the end of that array
